FLASK-STATICUTILS

Flask extension that provides a simple way to add revision info to your app
static assets.

WHAT

This extension provides:

* the ability to version application static files by checksum of the their
  contents (or any other user-defined method)

WHY

Because you MUST cache static content. But even though your static content
changes infrequently, when it does, the cached content needs to be invalidated.
Including the version of your content as part of URL (not querystring) allows to
control cache invalidation more flexibly.

HOW

pip install -e git+git@bitbucket.org:vitalk/flask-staticutils.git#egg=flask-staticutils

Use default flask API to customize following settings:

STATIC_UTILS_FORMATSTR      format string used to produce asset path,
                            default is '/%(path)s-%(rev)s%(ext)s'.
                            For example,
                            'foo/bar.css' → '/foo/bar-17e073c333c6.css'
                            'foo/bar' → '/foo/bar.17e073c333c6'

STATIC_UTILS_FILTER_NAME    name of jinja filter, default is 'rev'

STATIC_UTILS_REV_LENGTH     truncate revision to that length, default is 12
                            'foo/bar.css' → 'foo/bar-17e073c333c6.css'
                                                     |<-------->|
                                             checksum truncated to 12 symbols

STATIC_UTILS_REV_GENERATOR  ready to import path to the revision generator,
                            default is 'flask.ext.staticutils.FileChecksumRev'
